/**
 * Configuration classes for the Job Portal application.
 * <p>
 * This package contains Spring configuration classes that set up and customize
 * various aspects of the application infrastructure, including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Security configuration - JWT authentication and authorization rules</li>
 *   <li>MongoDB configuration - Database connection and settings</li>
 *   <li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - Security policy for cross-domain requests</li>
 *   <li>Exception handling for authentication - Custom responses for auth failures</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The configuration classes in this package define the foundation of the application,
 * establishing how the application connects to the database, handles security,
 * and processes requests from various origins. They work together to create a
 * secure, well-structured application infrastructure.
 * </p>
